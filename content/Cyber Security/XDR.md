#cyber-security #security 

XDR is cross-layered detection and response security system using a holistic approach to detect and respond to threats that would normally evade detection in a single vector solution by collaborating multiple data sources into multi-vector solution.

It can be used with either [[Cyber Security/SIEM]] or [[Cyber Security/SOAR]].
