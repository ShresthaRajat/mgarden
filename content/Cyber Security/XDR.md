# Extended Detection and Response (XDR)
#cyber-security #security 

XDR is cross-layered detection and response security system using a holistic approach to detect and respond to threats that would normally evade detection in a single vector solution by collaborating multiple data sources into multi-vector solution.

It can be used with either [SIEM](Cyber%20Security/SIEM.md) or [SOAR](Cyber%20Security/SOAR.md).
