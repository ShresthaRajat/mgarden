In cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority is an central entity that stores, signs, and issues digital certificates. A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate. The certificate authority utilizes [Asymmetric](Cyber%20Security/Cryptography/Encryption%20Asymmetric.md) Key [Encryption](Cyber%20Security/Cryptography/Encryption.md) in its mechanism to securely receive the CSR (Certificate Signing Request) and sign the certificate and provide it to the Applicant.
