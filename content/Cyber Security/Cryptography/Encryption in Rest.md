# Encryption in rest
#cyber-security #security #encryption 

[Encryption](Cyber%20Security/Cryptography/Encryption.md) of data at rest ensures the data is unreadable without the keys and secrets needed to de-crypt it. If an attacker obtained a data store with encrypted data and didn't have access to the encryption keys, they would be unable to read the data.
