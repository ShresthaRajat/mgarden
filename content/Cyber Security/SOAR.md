A SOAR collects data about security [](Cyber%20Security/Cloud%20Security/Threat%20Assessment.md#Threat%20%7CThreat%20Assessment) and responds to security Events without human assistantance 

## Security Orchestration
Connects various internal or external security tools via built-in or custom integrations like Vurnability scanners, [Firewalls](Firewalls), [SIEM](Cyber%20Security/SIEM.md) etc to trigger any events.

## Security Automation
Analyzes the security event to create Playbooks (repeatable, automated process to replace manual processes) eg [Auditing](Cyber%20Security/Cloud%20Security/Auditing.md), [Log analysis](Log%20analysis), etc.
