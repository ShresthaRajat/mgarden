Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it says it is. Authentication technology provides access control for systems by checking to see if a user's credentials match the credentials in a database of authorized users or in a data authentication server.


Authentication and [Authorization](Cyber%20Security/Cloud%20Security/Authorization.md) are two vital information security processes that administrators use to protect systems and information. Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service, and authorization determines their access rights.

When you want to access a computer or device, you'll encounter a similar type of authentication. You may get asked to enter a username and password. The username states who you are, but by itself isn't enough to grant you access. When combined with the password, which only that user should know, it allows access to your systems. The username and password, together, are a form of authentication. Authentication is sometimes shortened to AuthN.
