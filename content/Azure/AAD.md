Azure AD is not simply a cloud version of [Active Directory](Active%20Directory) in [Azure](Azure/Azure.md) as the name might suggest. Although it performs some of the same functions, it is quite different. Azure Active Directory is a secure online authentication store, which can contain users and groups.
