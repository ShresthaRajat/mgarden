Azure SQL Database is a PaaS deployment option of Azure SQL that abstracts both the OS and the SQL Server instance provided by [[Azure]]. An Azure SQL database is a fully managed service. You don't have to deal with complex database tasks like configuring and managing high availability, tuning, and backups. The service automatically upgrades each SQL database to run the most recent version of SQL Server. You get the latest SQL Server capabilities without having to perform manual updates.
