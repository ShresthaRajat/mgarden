## Azure Data Roles

### Data Engineer Tools
![Pasted image 20230217232108.png](Pasted%20image%2020230217232108.png)


## Data Overview
![Pasted image 20230217232341.png](Pasted%20image%2020230217232341.png)

### Data 
Basically Information


### Data Documents 
Collective Data (Datasets, Databases, Datastores, Data warehouses, notebooks)


### Datasets 
Logical Grouping of units of data (mnist, Stackoverflow developer dataset, etc)
![Pasted image 20230217232822.png](Pasted%20image%2020230217232822.png)


### Data Structure 
a specific storage format.
- unstructured (Sharepoint, blob, azure files, Azure Data Lakes) 
- semi-structured (slight relations XML, JSON, AVRO, PARQUET) (Azure Tables, Cosmos DB, Mongo, Cassandra)

![Pasted image 20230218001106.png](Pasted%20image%2020230218001106.png)
- structured 
usually just tables

### Data Type
Single unit of data to tell a computer how a data is intended to be used (Int, Float, Characters, String, Array, Hash, Binary, bool, enums etc) some of these overlap with data structures


## Schema
Blueprint of database
![Pasted image 20230217233245.png](Pasted%20image%2020230217233245.png)

### Schemaless
A cell can accept many types related to Nosql Databases



### Batch Processing
Usually a scheduled action to process a collection of data, are cost effective and is not real-time (ie, analysing daily logs)

### Stream Processing
For realtime data processing
Producers send to stream and Consumer pull from stream


### Relational Data
**Tables**: Logical grouping of rows and columns
**Views**: Result of query which is stored in memory (Temp table)
**Materialized** View: similar to Views but stored on disk
**Indexes**: copy of a column to accelerate stuff (By storing partial redundant data)
**Constraints**: Rules for writes
**Triggers**: A function triggered on a certain database event
**PK/FK**: A data to create relationship between tables

**Row Store**: generally used in relational database
**Column Store**: NoSQL Faster for analytics, good for  large amounts of data (OLTP), for limited columns use

**Pivot Tables**: A table of statistics easy to create in  Excel to draw attention to useful information and finding figures and facts quickly.

**Data Consistency**: when data is kept in many places and weather they match or not. (Strongly consistent vs Eventually Consistent).
Syncronous data transmissions are used in Strongly consistent data.

### Non Relational Data
- Key/Value
- Document
- Columnar
- Graph

### Data Sources
Where Data originates from, can be:
Data lake
Data warehouse
Datastore
Database
Data requested from API
Flat Files (spreadsheet)


### Data Store
A repo for storing data, Database is a subset of data store

### Database 
Stores semi-structured or structured data
A more complex data store with a formal design

### Data Warehouse
A relational data store for analytic workloads, utilizing usually column-oriented data-store to aggrigate huge amounts of data. they are desined to be HOT (fast). They are run in a schedule. It needs to consume data from a relational database.

### Data Mart
Subset of Datawarehouse which stores a smaller sets of data and are designed to be read only.

### Data Lake
A centralized place to store vast amount of raw data. Used for:
Visualization
Real-time analytics
Machine Learning

### Data Lakehouse
Combines the best elements of Data Lakes and Data warehouse.
Supports video, audio and text files, used for data science and ML.
support for both streaming and ELT

### Azure Synapse
Basically Data Lake or LakeHouse service by Azure

### Azure Data Lake Analytics
On demand analytics job service
![Pasted image 20230218112644.png](Pasted%20image%2020230218112644.png)


## Data Mining
![Pasted image 20230218001406.png](Pasted%20image%2020230218001406.png)
find valid patterns and relationships (classification, clustering, regression, sequential, association rules, Outer Detection, Prediction).

## Data Wrangling
Matching data from raw to other format. 


## Data Modelling
Organizing elements of data and standardises how they relate to one another. could be conceptial, logical or physical. example a ER diagram.


## ETL vs ELT
used when you want to move data from one location to another. Ie moving data from relational to non relational database

![Pasted image 20230218002020.png](Pasted%20image%2020230218002020.png)

## Data Analytics
Examining, transforming and arranging data to view useful information.
