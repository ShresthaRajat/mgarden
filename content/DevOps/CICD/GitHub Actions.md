# Github - Actions
#CICD 

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline by [GitHub](DevOps/SCR/GitHub.md). You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.
