Encription# Terraform
#cloud #IaC #terraform 

Terraform is a open-source infrastructure as code [IaC](DevOps/IAC/IaC.md) tool, which enables users to safely and predictably manage infrastructure. It helps in organizing large Infrastructures by managing it as code. Terraform enables developers to use a high-level configuration language called [HCL](HCL) (HashiCorp Configuration Language) to describe the desired “end-state” cloud or on-premises infrastructure for running an application. It then generates a plan for reaching that end-state and executes the plan to provision the infrastructure.

[Packer Azure Windows](DevOps/IAC/Packer/Packer%20Azure%20Windows.md) is a tool that is often used with terraform to create images (os images required for terraform) which are then used to spinup virtual machines.
