#git #source-control #version-control


Git is a distributed version control system: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. 

Git is a distributed version control system developed by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux Kernel. Initially developed to assist in developing the Linux Kernel, Git is powerful and easy to use. It supports linear development, which allows more than one developer to work on the same project concomitantly. It is widely used for collaboration of Opensource projects such as [Linux](Cyber%20Operations/Operation%20Tools/Linux.md).ï¿¼

.NET Core 3.1 will be supported until December 2022; 2.1 is also an LTS release with support until August 2021, and there are images availabl
