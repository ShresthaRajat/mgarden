#data  #bigdata #data-warehouse 

A data lakehouse is a new, big-data storage architecture that combines the best features of both [Data Warehouse](Software%20Engineering/Datastores/Big%20Data/Data%20Warehouse.md) and [Data Lakes](Software%20Engineering/Datastores/Big%20Data/Data%20Lakes.md). A data lakehouse enables a single repository for all your data (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured) while enabling best-in-class machine learning, business intelligence, and streaming capabilities.
