#data #bigdata #data-warehouse 

A data warehouse is a unified data repository for storing large amounts of information from multiple sources within an organization. A data warehouse represents a single source of “data truth” in an organization and serves as a core reporting and business analytics component.

TLDR a relational database on steroids and used for running analytings using [SQL](Software%20Engineering/Datastores/Databases/SQL.md) queries for [OLAP](Software%20Engineering/Datastores/Big%20Data/OLAP.md).
