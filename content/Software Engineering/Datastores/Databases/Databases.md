Database is a type of Datastore with structured and semi structured data. It can be a traditional and highly efficient [RDBMS](Software%20Engineering/Datastores/Databases/RDBMS.md) which can use [SQL](Software%20Engineering/Datastores/Databases/SQL.md) or a modern semi structured [NoSQL](Software%20Engineering/Datastores/Databases/NoSQL.md) Databases to store data in different types. Mostly this section will discuss the database used in [OLTP](OLTP). 

Different databases will be used for different scenarios, like an [ACID](Software%20Engineering/Datastores/Databases/ACID.md) Compliant database will be used for storing highly important atomic transactions while, a volatile data might be stored in another caching database for fast retrieval of non important data (non-consequential if changed or inaccurate).

In the modern day there are various other database paradigms upcoming like:

1. [Graph Database](Graph%20Database)
2. [Timeseries Database](Timeseries%20Database)
3. [Column based](Column%20based) or also known as [Wide Column](Wide%20Column)
4. [Key-Value](Key-Value)
