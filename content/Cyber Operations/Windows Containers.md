# Windows Containers
#windows #os #docker 


Windows containers are a different animal than a typical [Docker](Microservice%20Architecture/Docker/Docker.md) [container](container). It requires the window's container enabled and the linux container disabled in the docker settings within a [Windows](Windows) Opereting system. It is not supported in [Linux](Cyber%20Operations/Operation%20Tools/Linux.md) officially but there is a project that aims to bridge the gap [Mono](https://hub.docker.com/_/mono/).
