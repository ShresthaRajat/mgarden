# Docker Swarm
#docker #containers #container-orchestration


A Docker Swarm is a group of either physical or virtual machines that are running the [Docker](Microservice%20Architecture/Docker/Docker.md) application and that have been configured to join together in a cluster. The activities of the cluster are controlled by a swarm manager, and machines that have joined the cluster are referred to as nodes.


Docker Swarm is an alternative [Container orchestration](Container%20orchestration) platform to [Kubernetes](Microservice%20Architecture/Kubernetes/Kubernetes.md)
The major difference between the platforms is based on complexity. Kubernetes is well suited for complex applications. On the other hand, Docker Swarm is designed for ease of use, making it a preferable choice for simple applications.
