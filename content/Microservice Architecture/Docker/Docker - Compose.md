# Docker compose
#docker #containers 

It is a tool for defining and running multi-container [Docker](Microservice%20Architecture/Docker/Docker.md) applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services.

If you want to setup multi container application which requires different container components stiched together, docker-compose provides the functionality to make this happen. 

Compose revolves around a config file calledÂ `docker-compose.yml`. In it we define all of our services. Think of a service as a part of your application; a database or API for example. All of our services rely on an image with which we create a container. Spinning up a container can have many options; how these options are configured will be stored in the yml file.
