# Azure Traffic Manager
#Azure #cloud #networking 

A service from [Azure](Cloud%20Computing/Azure/Azure.md) to operate at the DNS layer to quickly and efficiently direct incoming DNS requests based on the routing method of your choice. (In AWS it is done within the **Route53**)
- Route traffic to servers the geographically near (reduces latency)
- Fail-over to redundant systems (increases fault-tolerance)
- Route traffics to random VM for A/B testing
