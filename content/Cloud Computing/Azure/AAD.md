# Azure Active Directory (AAD)

Azure AD is not simply a cloud version of [Active Directory](Cyber%20Security/Cloud%20Security/Active%20Directory.md) in [Azure](Cloud%20Computing/Azure/Azure.md) as the name might suggest. Although it performs some of the same functions, it is quite different. Azure Active Directory is a secure online authentication store, which can contain users and groups.
