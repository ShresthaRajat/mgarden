#Azure #cloud 

An [Azure](Cloud%20Computing/Azure/Azure.md) subscription isÂ **a logical container used to provision resources in Azure**. It holds the details of all your resources like virtual machines (VMs), databases, and more. When you create an Azure resource like a VM, you identify the subscription it belongs to.
