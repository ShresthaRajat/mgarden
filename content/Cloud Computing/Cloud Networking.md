# Cloud Networking
#cloud #networking 

Cloud computing has changed what we know about software design and the role/functions of data centers. The journey to the cloud begins with choosing a cloud provider and provisioning private networks or extending their on-premise network. Customers looking to provision their resources in the cloud can choose from the different private networks offered by the various cloud providers. The two most deployed private networks are Virtual Network [VNET](Cloud%20Computing/Azure/VNET.md) and Virtual Private Cloud [VPC](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Networking/VPC.md) from Microsoft and Amazon respectively. This blog looks at the similarities and differences between these two private network offerings with the goal of informing potential customers on what differentiates the two private networks and assist in their decision on which is suitable for their workload. In this first blog in the series, I will cover some basic components of every cloud network. This current blog will not compare the pricing due to its complexity, it may be covered in a future post. In this way computer [Networking](Networking/Networking.md) could be implemented in a cloud environment.
