# Kinesis
#aws #cloud #serverless #dataanalytics 

Family of services to collect, process and analyze streaming data in real-time by [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md).

  

Streaming data is simply data continuously generated by many data sources sending a small amount of information simultaneously. (Think of harvesting rainwater)

  

Deals with moving data (streaming data) similar to Kafka.

## Kinesis Streams

Enables us to stream data and video. (Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Video Streams).

(Eg recording online meeting video, Game score in real-time).

Uses Shards, retains data, and requires Consumers.

## Kinesis Data Firehose

- Load streaming data into AWS data stores for near-real-time analytics.  
- No Shards, No Data retention, Optional Consumer and Automatic Capacity
- Consumers are optional. (can Chose only one consumer)
- Data is not persisted
- Can use Lambda for processing data.
- Data is directly to the AWS store.
- Inexpensive

## Kinesis Data Analytics

For real time analytics. You need to specify Data Firehose or Data Stream

Allows running sql queries and stores the result on AWS datastore.

  
  

# Kinesis Shards

Kinesis streams are made up of shards.

Data capacity of streams are determined by shards.

Each shard is a sequence of one or more data records and provides a fixed unit of capacity.

(read: 5 per second, 2MB per second) (write: 1000 per second, 1MB per second).
