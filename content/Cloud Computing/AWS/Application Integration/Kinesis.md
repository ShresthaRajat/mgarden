# Kinesis
#aws #cloud #serverless #dataanalytics 

Family of services to collect, process and analyze streaming data in real-time by [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md).

Streaming data is simply data continuously generated by many data sources sending a small amount of information simultaneously. (Think of harvesting rainwater)

  

Deals with moving data (streaming data) similar to Kafka.

## Kinesis Streams

Enables us to stream data and video. (Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Video Streams).

(Eg recording online meeting video, Game score in real-time).

Uses Shards, retains data, and requires Consumers.

## Kinesis Data Firehose

- Load streaming data into AWS data stores for near-real-time analytics.  
- No Shards, No Data retention, Optional Consumer and Automatic Capacity
- Consumers are optional. (can Chose only one consumer)
- Data is not persisted
- Can use Lambda for processing data.
- Data is directly to the AWS store.
- Inexpensive

It can be used to load data directly into destinations like:
[S3](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Storage/S3.md) 
[Redshift](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Databases/Redshift.md)
[Elastic Search](Elastic%20Search)
etc

## Kinesis Data Analytics

For real time analytics using SQL. You need to specify Data Firehose, Data Stream or [Lambda](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Compute/Lambda.md) as destination. Provides analytics from [Kinesis Data Stream](#Kinesis%20Data%20Stream) and [Kinesis Data Firehose](#Kinesis%20Data%20Firehose)

Allows running SQL queries and stores the result on AWS data-store.

  
  

# Kinesis Shards

Kinesis streams are made up of shards.

Data capacity of streams are determined by shards.

Each shard is a sequence of one or more data records and provides a fixed unit of capacity.

(read: 5 per second, 2MB per second) (write: 1000 per second, 1MB per second).

## Kinesis Client Library

Ø Each shard is processed by exactly one KCL worker and has exactly one corresponding record processor 

Ø One worker can process any number of shards, so it's fine if the number of shards exceeds the number of instances
