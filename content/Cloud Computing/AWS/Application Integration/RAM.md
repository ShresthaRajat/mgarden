# AWS Resource Access Manager
#aws #cloud 

A fully managed service from [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md) to share resources across accounts. AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) helps you securely share your resources across AWS accounts, within your organization or organizational units (OUs) in [AWS Organizations](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Organizations/AWS%20Organization.md), and with [**IAM Roles**](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Security%20&%20Identity/IAM.md#**Roles**) and [**IAM Users**](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Security%20&%20Identity/IAM.md#**Users**) for supported resource types.


Basically for sharing resources with different accounts.
