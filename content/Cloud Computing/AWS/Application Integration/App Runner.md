# App Runner
#aws #cloud #containers 


A fully managed [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md) PaaS for deploying [Containerized](Microservice%20Architecture/Docker/Containers.md) web app and APIs. It creates an container using a source ([ECR](ECR) or [GitHub](DevOps/SCR/GitHub.md) or etc), it could be linked to [ELB](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Compute/ELB.md), convigured with [VPC](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Networking/VPC.md) and [CloudWatch](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Monitoring/CloudWatch.md) for monitoring. It is basically like an [EB](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Compute/EB.md) for containers.
