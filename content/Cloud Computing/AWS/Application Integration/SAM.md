# AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)
#aws #cloud #serverless 

A service in [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md) to ease the coding of wiring of serverless application without having to create complicated [CloudFormation](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Application%20Integration/CloudFormation.md) Templates. The  [Serverless Framework](Serverless%20Framework) actually uses SAM under the hood and it could be used to create a API gateway integration with Lambda  easily similar to the serverless framework workflow. Now there is also rise of [serverless.tf](https://serverless.tf/) which is a good alternative to serverless framework and sam.
