#aws #cloud #monitoring 

A [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md) managed service for Prometheus, which is an open-source monitoring system and time series database. This allows use of  open-source Prometheus query language (PromQL) to monitor and alert on the performance of containerized workloads. It automatically scales the ingestion, storage, alerting, and querying of operational metrics as workloads grow or shrink. It can be integrated with Amazon [EKS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Compute/EKS.md), Amazon [ECS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Compute/ECS.md), and AWS [Distro](Distro) for OpenTelemetry.
