# AWS Organization
#aws #cloud #organization 

An account management service from [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md) that lets you consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage**. With Organizations, you can create member accounts and invite existing accounts to join your organization.

You can use [AWS Control Tower](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Organizations/AWS%20Control%20Tower.md) to create [SCP](daily/2023/February/SCP.md)s among several accounts.
