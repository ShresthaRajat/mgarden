# AWS DataSync
#cloud #aws #cloud-migration 

A data migration service from [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md) that helps on moving data  securely online between on-premises and AWS storage services ([EFS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Storage/EFS.md), [S3](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Storage/S3.md), [FSX](FSX)) . 

You can use this service via a DataSync Software which connectes to your Storage solution or you can alternatively use a AWS [snowcone](snowcone) device connected.
