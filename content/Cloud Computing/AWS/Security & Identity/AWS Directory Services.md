AWS Directory Service provides multiple directory choices for customers who want to use existing Microsoft [Active Directory](Cyber%20Security/Cloud%20Security/Active%20Directory.md) or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)–aware applications in the cloud via [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md). It also offers those same choices to developers who need a directory to manage users, groups, devices, and access.
