# AWS Managed Microsoft AD
#aws #cloud #Active-Directory #Microsoft 

AWS Directory Service lets you run Microsoft  [Active Directory](Cyber%20Security/Cloud%20Security/Active%20Directory.md) as a managed service in [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md). AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, also referred to as AWS Managed Microsoft AD, is powered by Windows Server 2019. When you select and launch this directory type, it is created as a highly available pair of domain controllers connected to your virtual private cloud (VPC). The domain controllers run in different Availability Zones in a Region of your choice. Host monitoring and recovery, data replication, snapshots, and software updates are automatically configured and managed for you.
