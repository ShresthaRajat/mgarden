#aws #cloud #security #cloud-security 

A fully managed data security and data privacy software by [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md). It uses ML and pattern matching algorithms to detect sensitive data that are stored in Amazon [S3](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Storage/S3.md). Macie can help prevent exposure of the following sensitive data like:
	- Protected Health Information
	- Regulatory Documents
	- API Keys as well as Secrets Keys.

1. IT can also identify changes to policies and [ACLs](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Storage/S3.md#S3%20Security). 
2. Can continuously monitor the security posture of Amazon S3.
3. Generate security findings that you can view using the Macie console, AWS [Security Hub](Security%20Hub), or Amazon [Event Bridge](Event%20Bridge)
4. Manage multiple AWS accounts using AWS Organizations.
