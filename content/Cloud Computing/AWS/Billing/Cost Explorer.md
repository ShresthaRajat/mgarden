A tool from [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md)  that allows you to view charts of your costs:

## Uses:

• Cost Explorer can help you to identify service usage statistics such as:
	• Which services you use the most
	• View metrics for which AZ has the most traffic
	• Which linked account is used the most
