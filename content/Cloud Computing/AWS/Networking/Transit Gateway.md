Simply like a powerful virtual [Router](Router) like service by [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md).
AWS Transit Gateway connects your [VPC](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Networking/VPC.md) and on-premises networks through a central hub. This connection simplifies your network and puts an end to complex peering relationships. Transit Gateway acts as a highly scalable cloud routerâ€”each new connection is made only once.
