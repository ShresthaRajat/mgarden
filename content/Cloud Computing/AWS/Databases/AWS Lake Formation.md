# AWS Lake Formation
#aws #cloud #bigdata #data-lake

A [Data Lake](Software%20Engineering/Datastores/Big%20Data/Data%20Lakes.md) solution from [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md) to set up secure data lakes in days where data can be collected from databases and object storage into [S3](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Storage/S3.md) Data Lake. These data can be cleaned and classified using ML algorithms. It builds on the capabilities available in AWS [Glue](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Databases/Glue.md). The data sets can then be used through services such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon [Athena](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Databases/Athena.md), Amazon [EMR](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Databases/EMR.md) for Apache [Spark](Spark), and Amazon [QuickSight](QuickSight). Security can be applied at column, row, and cell-levels.
