Amazon MSK is a fully managed apache kafka service from [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md) used for ingesting and processing streaming data in real-time like [Kinesis](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Application%20Integration/Kinesis.md). It provisions, configures, and maintains Apache Kafka clusters and Apache ZooKeeper nodes.

Security levels include:
	• [VPC](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Networking/VPC.md) network isolation
	• AWS [IAM](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Security%20&%20Identity/IAM.md) for control-plane API authorization
	• Encryption at rest
	• TLS encryption in-transit
	• TLS based certificate authentication
	• SASL/SCRAM authentication secured by AWS [Secrets Manager](Secrets%20Manager)
