# Database on EC2
#aws #cloud #sql #databases #rdbms

Create a self managed [EC2](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Compute/EC2.md) instance with manually configured Database if you want full control and ultimate flexibility unlike of [RDS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Databases/RDS.md).

All of the management will be in your hands, like backups, maintenance, update etc.

Where using Database mirroring through the EC2 instance will be faster and meet the RTO.
