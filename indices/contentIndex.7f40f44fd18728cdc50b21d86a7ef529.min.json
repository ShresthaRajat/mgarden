Azure AD can also help you maintain your on-premises [[Active Directory]] deployment.\n\nAzure AD provides services such as:\n\n- **Authentication**: This includes verifying identity to access applications and resources. It also includes providing functionality such as self-service password reset, multi-factor authentication, a custom list of banned passwords, and smart lockout services.\n\n- **Single sign-on**: Single sign-on (SSO) enables you to remember only one username and one password to access multiple applications. A single identity is tied to a user, which simplifies the security model. As users change roles or leave an organization, access modifications are tied to that identity, which greatly reduces the effort needed to change or disable accounts.\n\n- **Application management**: You can manage your cloud and on-premises apps by using Azure AD. Features like Application Proxy, SaaS apps, the My Apps portal, and single sign-on provide a better user experience.\n\n- **Device management**: Along with accounts for individual people, Azure AD supports the registration of devices. Registration enables devices to be managed through tools like Microsoft Intune. It also allows for device-based Conditional Access policies to restrict access attempts to only those coming from known devices, regardless of the requesting user account.","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T17:12:22.231866826Z","tags":null},"/Azure/Azure-DNS":{"title":"Azure DNS","content":"# Azure DNS\n#Azure #cloud #networking \n\nThis service is used to manage your DNS records and also host them.

Your choices include SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Tables, and Gremlin. This allows the user to keep the native API (i.e. no changes to the application code).\n\n## Managed Database engines:\nAzure provides fully managed database capabilities for SQLServer, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases which provides the following benifits:\n-   Built-in high availability with no additional cost.\n-   Predictable performance and inclusive, pay-as-you-go pricing.\n-   Scale as needed, within seconds.\n-   Ability to protect sensitive data at rest and in motion.\n-   Automatic backups.\n-   Enterprise-grade security and compliance.\n\n### Azure Database for MySQL\n\nAzure Database for MySQL offers several service tiers, and each tier provides different performance and capabilities to support lightweight to heavyweight database workloads. You can build your first app on a small database for a few dollars a month, then adjust the scale to meet the needs of your solution. Dynamic scalability enables your database to transparently respond to rapidly changing resource requirements. You only pay for the resources you need, and only when you need them.\n\n\n### Azure Database for PostgreSQL\n\nAzure Database for PostgreSQL is a relational database service in the cloud. The server software is based on the community version of the open-source PostgreSQL database engine. Your familiarity with tools and expertise with PostgreSQL is applicable when you're using Azure Database for PostgreSQL.\n\nAzure Database for PostgreSQL is available in two deployment options: **Single Server** and **Hyperscale (Citus)**.\n\n**Single Server**\nAll those capabilities require almost no administration, and all are provided at no additional cost. You can focus on rapid application development and accelerating your time to market rather than having to manage virtual machines and infrastructure. You can continue to develop your application with the open-source tools and platform of your choice, without having to learn new skills.\n\nThe Single Server deployment option offers three pricing tiers: Basic, General Purpose, and Memory Optimized. Each tier offers different resource capabilities to support your database workloads. You can build your first app on a small database for a few dollars a month, then adjust the scale to meet the needs of your solution. Dynamic scalability enables your database to transparently respond to rapidly changing resource requirements. You only pay for the resources you need, and only when you need them.\n\n**Hyperscale (Citus)**\nThe Hyperscale (Citus) option horizontally scales queries across multiple machines by using sharding. Its query engine parallelizes incoming SQL queries across these servers for faster responses on large datasets. It serves applications that require greater scale and performance, generally workloads that are approaching, or already exceed, 100 GB of data.\n\nThe Hyperscale (Citus) deployment option supports multi-tenant applications, real-time operational analytics, and high-throughput transactional workloads. Applications built for PostgreSQL can run distributed queries on Hyperscale (Citus) with standard connection libraries and minimal changes.\n\n\n### Azure SQL Managed Instance (MI) \n\nSQL Managed Instance (SQL MI) provides native Virtual Network (VNet) integration while Azure SQL Database enables restricted Virtual Network (VNet) access using [[VNet]] Endpoints and SQL MI also helps bridge the gap between Azure SQL Database and On-premises SQL Server due to being built on an instance scoped configuration model.\n\nAzure SQL Managed Instance (MI) is similar to The Azure [[SQL-Database]] on the following topics:\nManagement\n1. Backup\n2. Availability\n3. Host Accessibility\n4. License\n\nHowever the key differences are:\n**1.

You can use a VNets to:\n\n-   **Communicate between Azure resources**: You can deploy VMs, and several other types of Azure resources to a virtual network, such as Azure App Service Environments, the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets.\n    \n-   **Communicate between each other**: You can connect virtual networks to each other, enabling resources in either virtual network to communicate with each other, using virtual network peering. The virtual networks you connect can be in the same, or different, Azure regions.\n    \n-   **Communicate to the internet**: All resources in a VNet can communicate outbound to the internet, by default. You can communicate inbound to a resource by assigning a public IP address or a public Load Balancer. You can also use [Public IP addresses](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-public-ip-address) or public [Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) to manage your outbound connections.\n    \n-   **Communicate with on-premises networks**: You can connect your on-premises computers and networks to a virtual network using [VPN Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) or [ExpressRoute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction).\n    \n\nWhen you design a network from bottom up, you gather some basic information. This information could be number of hosts, network devices, number of [[subnets]], routing between subnets, isolation domains such as VLANs. This information helps in sizing the network and security devices as well creating the architecture to support applications and services.\n\nWhen you plan to deploy your applications and services in Azure, you will start by creating a logical boundary in Azure, which is called a virtual network. This virtual network is akin to a physical network boundary. As it is a virtual network, you don't need physical gear but still have to plan for the logical entities such as IP addresses, IP subnets, routing, and policies.\n\nWhen you create a virtual network in Azure, it's pre-configured with an IP range (10.0.0.0/16). This range isn't fixed, you can define your own IP range. You can define both IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges. IP ranges defined for the virtual network are not advertised to Internet. You can create multiple subnets from your IP range. These subnets will be used to assign IP addresses to virtual network interfaces (vNICs). Azure reserves the first four and last IP address for a total of 5 IP addresses within each subnet. There is no concept of VLANs in a public cloud. However, you can create isolation within a virtual network based on your defined subnets.\n\nYou can create one large subnet encompassing all the virtual network address space or choose to create multiple subnets.\n\nA virtual network is a virtual, isolated portion of the Azure public network. Each virtual network is dedicated to your subscription. Things to consider when deciding whether to create one virtual network, or multiple virtual networks in a subscription:\n\n-   Do any organizational security requirements exist for isolating traffic into separate virtual networks? You can choose to connect virtual networks or not. If you connect virtual networks, you can implement a network virtual appliance, such as a firewall, to control the flow of traffic between the virtual networks. For more information, visit [security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-vnet-plan-design-arm?toc=/azure/networking/fundamentals/toc.json) and [connectivity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-vnet-plan-design-arm?toc=/azure/networking/fundamentals/toc.json).\n    \n-   Do any organizational requirements exist for isolating virtual networks into separate [subscriptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-vnet-plan-design-arm?toc=/azure/networking/fundamentals/toc.json) or [regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-vnet-plan-design-arm?toc=/azure/networking/fundamentals/toc.json)?\n    \n-   A [network interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-network-interface) enables a VM to communicate with other resources. Each network interface has one or more private IP addresses assigned to it. How many network interfaces and [private IP addresses](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/private-ip-addresses) do you require in a virtual network? There are [limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json) to the number of network interfaces and private IP addresses that you can have within a virtual network.\n\n[[Azure NSG]]\n\n[[Azure NACL]]","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T17:12:22.231866826Z","tags":null},"/notes/callouts":{"title":"Callouts","content":"\n## Callout support\n\nQuartz supports the same Admonition-callout syntax as Obsidian.\n\nThis includes\n- 12 Distinct callout types (each with several aliases)\n- Collapsable callouts\n\nSee [documentation on supported types and syntax here](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Use+callouts#Types).\n\n## Showcase\n\n\u003e [!EXAMPLE] Examples\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: example\n\n\u003e [!note] Notes\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: note\n\n\u003e [!abstract] Summaries \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: abstract, summary, tldr\n\n\u003e [!info] Info \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: info, todo\n\n\u003e [!tip] Hint \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: tip, hint, important\n\n\u003e [!success] Success \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: success, check, done\n\n\u003e [!question] Question \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: question, help, faq\n\n\u003e [!warning] Warning \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: warning, caution, attention\n\n\u003e [!failure] Failure \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: failure, fail, missing\n\n\u003e [!danger] Error\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: danger, error\n\n\u003e [!bug] Bug\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: bug\n\n\u003e [!quote] Quote\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: quote, cite\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T17:12:22.231866826Z","tags":null},"/notes/config":{"title":"Configuration","content":"\n## Configuration\nQuartz is designed to be extremely configurable. You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T17:12:22.231866826Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

(Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index. Enjoy natural language search powered by Operand!\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T17:12:22.231866826Z","tags":null},"/notes/troubleshooting":{"title":"Troubleshooting and FAQ","content":"\nStill having trouble? Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T17:12:22.231866826Z","tags":null}}
