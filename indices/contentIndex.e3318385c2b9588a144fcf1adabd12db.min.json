The computer generally hosts a single application or process, for example, a proxy server or load balancer, and all other services are removed or limited to reduce the threat to the computer. It is hardened in this manner primarily due to its location and purpose, which is either on the outside of a firewall or inside of a demilitarized zone ([DMZ](Cyber%20Security/Cloud%20Security/DMZ.md)) and usually involves access from untrusted networks or computers. These computers are also equipped with special networking interfaces to withstand high-bandwidth attacks through the internet.\n\n\nMost often the [Security Groups](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Networking/Security%20Groups.md) of the bastion is added to the security group of the instance to be accessed.

Basically a container for an IAM role that you can use to pass role information to an EC2 instance when the instance starts.\n\n\n\n## Auto Scaling Groups\nSet scaling rules which will add or reduce ec2 instance in an group to meet the demand of the traffic. \n\n### ASG-Capacity Settings\n\nThe size of tan ASG is based on Min, Max and Desired Capacity.\n\nASG will always launch instances to meet minimum capacity.\n\n\n### Health Check Replacements\n\n#### 1. EC2 Health Check\n[EC2 health check](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html) watches for instance availability from hypervisor and networking point of view. For example, in case of a hardware problem, the check will fail. Also, if an instance was misconfigured and doesn't respond to network requests, it will be marked as faulty.\n\n#### 2. ELB Health Check\n[ELB health check](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-healthchecks.html) verifies that a specified TCP port on an instance is accepting connections OR a specified web page returns 2xx code. Thus ELB health checks are a little bit smarter and verify that actual app works instead of verifying that just an instance works.\n\n#### 3. Custom Health Check\nIf your application can't be checked by simple HTTP request and requires advanced test logic, you can implement a custom check in your code and set instance health though API: [Health Checks for Auto Scaling Instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/healthcheck.html)\n\n### Scaling Polices\nScale out or in to add or remove instances in an ASG.\nAmazon’s EC2 Auto Scaling provides an effective way to ensure that your infrastructure is able to dynamically respond to changing user demands. For example, to accommodate a sudden traffic increase on your web application, you can set your Auto Scaling group to automatically add more instances. And when traffic is low, have it automatically reduce the number of instances. This is a cost-effective solution since it only provisions EC2 instances when you need them. EC2 Auto Scaling provides you with several dynamic scaling policies to control the scale-in and scale-out events.\n\n#### 1. Simple Scaling\nSimple scaling relies on a metric as a basis for scaling. For example, you can set a CloudWatch alarm to have a CPU Utilization threshold of 80%, and then set the scaling policy to add 20% more capacity to your Auto Scaling group by launching new instances. Accordingly, you can also set a CloudWatch alarm to have a CPU utilization threshold of 30%. When the threshold is met, the Auto Scaling group will remove 20% of its capacity by terminating EC2 instances. \n\nWhen EC2 Auto Scaling was first introduced, this was the only scaling policy supported. It does not provide any fine-grained control to scaling in and scaling out.\n\n#### 2. Target Tracking\nTarget tracking policy lets you specify a scaling metric and metric value that your auto scaling group should maintain at all times. Let’s say for example your scaling metric is the average CPU utilization of your EC2 auto scaling instances, and that their average should always be 80%. When CloudWatch detects that the average CPU utilization is beyond 80%, it will trigger your target tracking policy to scale out the auto scaling group to meet this target utilization. Once everything is settled and the average CPU utilization has gone below 80%, another scale in action will kick in and reduce the number of auto scaling instances in your auto scaling group. With target tracking policies, your auto scaling group will always be running in a capacity that is defined by your scaling metric and metric value.\n\n#### 3. Step Scaling\nStep Scaling further improves the features of simple scaling. Step scaling applies “step adjustments” which means you can set multiple actions to vary the scaling depending on the size of the alarm breach. \n\nWhen a scaling event happens on simple scaling, the policy must wait for the health checks to complete and the cooldown to expire before responding to an additional alarm. This causes a delay in increasing capacity especially when there is a sudden surge of traffic on your application. With step scaling, the policy can continue to respond to additional alarms even in the middle of the scaling event. \n\nHere is an example that shows how step scaling works:\n\n![Step Scaling vs Simple Scaling Policies in Amazon EC2](https://td-mainsite-cdn.tutorialsdojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Step-Scaling1.jpg)","lastmodified":"2023-03-22T01:00:48.469014193Z","tags":null},"/Cloud-Computing/AWS/Compute/EC2-Spot":{"title":"EC2 Spot","content":"# EC2 Spot Instances\n#aws #compute #ec2 \n\n[AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md) Provides a cheaper alternative compute solution in [Elastic Compute Cloud EC2](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Compute/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20EC2.md) for non important tasks.

They all implement health checks, which are used to detect unhealthy instances. They are all highly available and elastic (in AWS parlance: They scale up and down within a few minutes according to workload). \n\nTLS termination is a feature available for all three as well, and they can all be either internet-facing or internal. Finally, ELB, ALB, and NLB all export useful metrics to CloudWatch and can log pertinent information to CloudWatch Logs.\n\n![Pasted image 20220723213315](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220723213315.png)\n\n\n# Classic Load Balancer (CLB)\n\nWidely known as CLB it was the original Elastic Load Balancer, as this was its name when it was first introduced in 2009 and was the only type of load balancer available. It can be thought of as an Nginx or HAProxy instance if that makes it easier for you to understand.\n\nELB works at both layer 4 (TCP) and 7 (HTTP) but not on the same time. It is the only load balancer that works in EC2-Classic, in case you have a very old AWS account. Also, it’s the only load balancer that supports application-defined sticky session cookies; in contrast, ALB uses its own cookies, and you have no control over that.\n\nAt layer 7, ELB can terminate TLS traffic. It can also re-encrypt the traffic to the targets as long as they provide an SSL certificate (a self-signed certificate is fine, BTW). This provides end-to-end encryption, which is a usual requirement in many compliance programs. Optionally, ELB can be configured to verify the TLS certificate provided by the target for extra security.\n\nELB has quite a few limitations. For example, it isn’t compatible with EKS containers running on Fargate. Also, it can’t forward traffic on more than one port per instance, and it doesn’t support forwarding to IP addresses—it can only forward to explicit EC2 instances or containers in ECS or EKS. Finally, ELB doesn’t support websockets; however, you may be able to work around this limitation by using layer 4.\n\nTo run an ELB in the us-east-1 region, it will cost you $0.025 per ELB-hour + $0.008 per GB of traffic.\n\nAWS discourages the use of ELB in favor of its newer load balancers. Admittedly, there are very few scenarios where the use of an ELB would be preferable; typically, these are cases where you simply don’t have a choice. For example, your workload might still run on [EC2-Classic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-classic-platform.html), or you need the load balancer to use your own sticky session cookies, in which cases ELB would be the only option available to you.\n\n\n\n## Application Load Balancer (ALB)\n\nIt works only on layer 7 (HTTP) of the [OSI](Networking/OSI.md). It has a wide range of routing rules for incoming requests based on host name, path, query string parameter, HTTP method, HTTP headers, source IP, or port number. In contrast, ELB only allows routing based on port number. Also, contrary to ELB, ALB can route requests to many ports on a single target. Plus, ALB can route requests to Lambda functions.\n\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230305234453.png)\n\nIt has a feature called Request Routing which allows you to add routing rules to your application.\n\nA very useful feature of ALB is that it can be configured to return a fixed response or a redirection. So you don’t need a server to perform such basic tasks because it is all embedded in the ALB itself. Also very importantly, ALB supports HTTP/2 and websockets.\n\nALB further supports [Server Name Indication (SNI)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/), which allows it to serve many domain names. (In contrast, ELB can serve only one domain name). There is a limit, however, to the number of certificates you can attach to an ALB, [namely 25 certificates](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-application-load-balancer-sni/) plus the default certificate.\n\nAn interesting feature of ALB is that it supports user authentication via a variety of methods, including OIDC, SAML, LDAP, Microsoft AD, and well-known social identity providers such as Facebook and Google. This can help you off-load the user authentication part of your application to the load balancer. \n\nALB pricing is a bit more complicated than ELB. For the us-east-1 region, it would cost you $0.0225 per ALB + $0.008 per LCU-hour. The definition of an LCU can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/pricing/). All in all, pricing is roughly equivalent to ELB.\n\nALBs are typically used for web applications. If you have a microservices architecture, ALB can be used as an internal load balancer in front of EC2 instances or Docker containers that implement a given service. You can also use them in front of an application implementing a REST API, although [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) would generally be a better choice here.\n\n## Network Load Balancer\n\nNLB works on the layer 4 of the [OSI model](OSI%20model) only and can handle both TCP and UDP, as well as TCP connections encrypted with TLS. Its main feature is that it has a very high performance. Also, it uses static IP addresses and can be assigned Elastic IPs—not possible with ALB and ELB.\n\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230305234508.png)\n\nNLB natively preserves the source IP address in TCP/UDP packets; in contrast, ALB and ELB can be configured to add additional HTTP headers with forwarding information, and those have to be parsed properly by your application.\n\nNLB pricing for the us-east-1 region is $0.0225 per NLB-hour + $0.006 per LCU-hour. The definition of an LCU for NLB is quite similar to that for ALB, and more information can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/pricing/). All in all, pricing is roughly equivalent to ELB and ALB.\n\nNLBs would be used for anything that ALBs don’t cover. A typical use case would be a near real-time data streaming service (video, stock quotes, etc.) Another typical case is that you would need to use an NLB if your application uses non-HTTP protocols.\n\n\n## Gateway Load Balancer\nA new loadbalancer available in select regioins Used in front of virtual appliances such as firewalls, IDS/IPS, and deep packet inspection systems.\n\n• Operates at Layer 3 – listens for all packets on all ports\n• Forwards traffic to the TG specified in the listener rules\n• Exchanges traffic with appliances using the GENEVE protocol on port 6081\n\n\n## Using security groups with ALB vs NLB\n\nwhile using [Security Groups](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Networking/Security%20Groups.md) with the different types of Elastic load balancer we must understand the difference between how the ALB and NLB works. \n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230305235141.png)\n\n## SSL/TLS Termination\nThe [Encryption](Cyber%20Security/Cryptography/Encryption.md) terminates at ALB at default but we can include certificate within the end instance so that the encryption is maintained throughout, even within the VPC.\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230305235606.png)\n\nIn case of NLB the [Encryption](Cyber%20Security/Cryptography/Encryption.md) is not broken and there will be a single encripted connection till the EC2 instances. \n\nWe can also use different Certificate to create different Encryption paths till the Instance through the NLB as we had done in the ALB.\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230305235757.png)\n\n## Sticky Session\n\nA method to bind a user's session to a specific EC2 session.\ncan only be applied to CLB or ALBs\n\nIt ensures that all requests from that session are sent to the same instance.

Basically a container for an IAM role that you can use to pass role information to an EC2 instance when the instance starts.\n\n\n## Elastic Load Balance\n\n\n## Auto Scaling Groups\nSet scaling rules which will add or reduce ec2 instance in an group to meet the demand of the traffic. \n\n### ASG-Capacity Settings\n\nThe size of tan ASG is based on Min, Max and Desired Capacity.\n\nASG will always launch instances to meet minimum capacity.\n\n\n### Health Check Replacements\n\n#### 1. EC2 Health Check\n[EC2 health check](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html) watches for instance availability from hypervisor and networking point of view. For example, in case of a hardware problem, the check will fail. Also, if an instance was misconfigured and doesn't respond to network requests, it will be marked as faulty.\n\n#### 2. ELB Health Check\n[ELB health check](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-healthchecks.html) verifies that a specified TCP port on an instance is accepting connections OR a specified web page returns 2xx code. Thus ELB health checks are a little bit smarter and verify that actual app works instead of verifying that just an instance works.\n\n#### 3. Custom Health Check\nIf your application can't be checked by simple HTTP request and requires advanced test logic, you can implement a custom check in your code and set instance health though API: [Health Checks for Auto Scaling Instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/healthcheck.html)\n\n### Scaling Polices\nScale out or in to add or remove instances in an ASG.\nAmazon’s EC2 Auto Scaling provides an effective way to ensure that your infrastructure is able to dynamically respond to changing user demands. For example, to accommodate a sudden traffic increase on your web application, you can set your Auto Scaling group to automatically add more instances. And when traffic is low, have it automatically reduce the number of instances. This is a cost-effective solution since it only provisions EC2 instances when you need them. EC2 Auto Scaling provides you with several dynamic scaling policies to control the scale-in and scale-out events.\n\n#### 1. Simple Scaling\nSimple scaling relies on a metric as a basis for scaling. For example, you can set a CloudWatch alarm to have a CPU Utilization threshold of 80%, and then set the scaling policy to add 20% more capacity to your Auto Scaling group by launching new instances. Accordingly, you can also set a CloudWatch alarm to have a CPU utilization threshold of 30%. When the threshold is met, the Auto Scaling group will remove 20% of its capacity by terminating EC2 instances. \n\nWhen EC2 Auto Scaling was first introduced, this was the only scaling policy supported. It does not provide any fine-grained control to scaling in and scaling out.\n\n#### 2. Target Tracking\nTarget tracking policy lets you specify a scaling metric and metric value that your auto scaling group should maintain at all times. Let’s say for example your scaling metric is the average CPU utilization of your EC2 auto scaling instances, and that their average should always be 80%. When CloudWatch detects that the average CPU utilization is beyond 80%, it will trigger your target tracking policy to scale out the auto scaling group to meet this target utilization. Once everything is settled and the average CPU utilization has gone below 80%, another scale in action will kick in and reduce the number of auto scaling instances in your auto scaling group. With target tracking policies, your auto scaling group will always be running in a capacity that is defined by your scaling metric and metric value.\n\n#### 3. Step Scaling\nStep Scaling further improves the features of simple scaling. Step scaling applies “step adjustments” which means you can set multiple actions to vary the scaling depending on the size of the alarm breach. \n\nWhen a scaling event happens on simple scaling, the policy must wait for the health checks to complete and the cooldown to expire before responding to an additional alarm. This causes a delay in increasing capacity especially when there is a sudden surge of traffic on your application. With step scaling, the policy can continue to respond to additional alarms even in the middle of the scaling event. \n\nHere is an example that shows how step scaling works:\n\n![Step Scaling vs Simple Scaling Policies in Amazon EC2](https://td-mainsite-cdn.tutorialsdojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Step-Scaling1.jpg)","lastmodified":"2023-03-22T01:00:48.473014544Z","tags":null},"/Cloud-Computing/AWS/Compute/Elastic-Load-Balancer-ELB":{"title":"Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)","content":"# Elastic Load balancer (ELB)\n#aws #cloud #vpc #networking #loadbalancer\n\nLoadbalancer service provided by [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md)\n\nElastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers: **Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers**.\n\n## Common Features\n\nLet’s start by taking a look at what is common for all three types of load balancers. \n\nObviously, all AWS load balancers distribute incoming requests to a number of targets, which can be either EC2 instances or Docker containers. They all implement health checks, which are used to detect unhealthy instances. They are all highly available and elastic (in AWS parlance: They scale up and down within a few minutes according to workload). \n\nTLS termination is a feature available for all three as well, and they can all be either internet-facing or internal. Finally, ELB, ALB, and NLB all export useful metrics to CloudWatch and can log pertinent information to CloudWatch Logs.\n\n![Pasted image 20220723213315](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Compute/Pasted%20image%2020220723213315.png)\n\n\n# Classic Load Balancer (CLB)\n\nWidely known as CLB it was the original Elastic Load Balancer, as this was its name when it was first introduced in 2009 and was the only type of load balancer available. It can be thought of as an Nginx or HAProxy instance if that makes it easier for you to understand.\n\nELB works at both layer 4 (TCP) and 7 (HTTP) but not on the same time. It is the only load balancer that works in EC2-Classic, in case you have a very old AWS account. Also, it’s the only load balancer that supports application-defined sticky session cookies; in contrast, ALB uses its own cookies, and you have no control over that.\n\nAt layer 7, ELB can terminate TLS traffic. It can also re-encrypt the traffic to the targets as long as they provide an SSL certificate (a self-signed certificate is fine, BTW). This provides end-to-end encryption, which is a usual requirement in many compliance programs. Optionally, ELB can be configured to verify the TLS certificate provided by the target for extra security.\n\nELB has quite a few limitations. For example, it isn’t compatible with EKS containers running on Fargate. Also, it can’t forward traffic on more than one port per instance, and it doesn’t support forwarding to IP addresses—it can only forward to explicit EC2 instances or containers in ECS or EKS. Finally, ELB doesn’t support websockets; however, you may be able to work around this limitation by using layer 4.\n\nTo run an ELB in the us-east-1 region, it will cost you $0.025 per ELB-hour + $0.008 per GB of traffic.\n\nAWS discourages the use of ELB in favor of its newer load balancers. Admittedly, there are very few scenarios where the use of an ELB would be preferable; typically, these are cases where you simply don’t have a choice. For example, your workload might still run on [EC2-Classic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-classic-platform.html), or you need the load balancer to use your own sticky session cookies, in which cases ELB would be the only option available to you.\n\n\n\n## Application Load Balancer (ALB)\n\nIt works only on layer 7 (HTTP) of the [OSI](Networking/OSI.md). It has a wide range of routing rules for incoming requests based on host name, path, query string parameter, HTTP method, HTTP headers, source IP, or port number. In contrast, ELB only allows routing based on port number. Also, contrary to ELB, ALB can route requests to many ports on a single target. Plus, ALB can route requests to Lambda functions.\n\nIt has a feature called Request Routing which allows you to add routing rules to your application.\n\nA very useful feature of ALB is that it can be configured to return a fixed response or a redirection. So you don’t need a server to perform such basic tasks because it is all embedded in the ALB itself. Also very importantly, ALB supports HTTP/2 and websockets.\n\nALB further supports [Server Name Indication (SNI)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/), which allows it to serve many domain names. (In contrast, ELB can serve only one domain name). There is a limit, however, to the number of certificates you can attach to an ALB, [namely 25 certificates](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-application-load-balancer-sni/) plus the default certificate.\n\nAn interesting feature of ALB is that it supports user authentication via a variety of methods, including OIDC, SAML, LDAP, Microsoft AD, and well-known social identity providers such as Facebook and Google. This can help you off-load the user authentication part of your application to the load balancer. \n\nALB pricing is a bit more complicated than ELB. For the us-east-1 region, it would cost you $0.0225 per ALB + $0.008 per LCU-hour. The definition of an LCU can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/pricing/). All in all, pricing is roughly equivalent to ELB.\n\nALBs are typically used for web applications. If you have a microservices architecture, ALB can be used as an internal load balancer in front of EC2 instances or Docker containers that implement a given service. You can also use them in front of an application implementing a REST API, although [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) would generally be a better choice here.\n\n## Network Load Balancer\n\nNLB works on the layer 4 of the [OSI model](OSI%20model) only and can handle both TCP and UDP, as well as TCP connections encrypted with TLS. Its main feature is that it has a very high performance. Also, it uses static IP addresses and can be assigned Elastic IPs—not possible with ALB and ELB.\n\nNLB natively preserves the source IP address in TCP/UDP packets; in contrast, ALB and ELB can be configured to add additional HTTP headers with forwarding information, and those have to be parsed properly by your application.\n\nNLB pricing for the us-east-1 region is $0.0225 per NLB-hour + $0.006 per LCU-hour. The definition of an LCU for NLB is quite similar to that for ALB, and more information can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/pricing/). All in all, pricing is roughly equivalent to ELB and ALB.\n\nNLBs would be used for anything that ALBs don’t cover. A typical use case would be a near real-time data streaming service (video, stock quotes, etc.) Another typical case is that you would need to use an NLB if your application uses non-HTTP protocols.\n\n## Sticky Session\n\nA method to bind a user's session to a specific EC2 session.\ncan only be applied to CLB or ALBs\n\nIt ensures that all requests from that session are sent to the same instance. It is Typically utilized with a Classic Load Balancer\n\n## X-Forwarded-For (XFF) Header\n\nIf you need the IPv4 address of a user, check this header.\n\nThis header is a common method for identifying the originating IP addresses of clients connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or a load balancer.\n\n![Pasted image 20220723214311](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Compute/Pasted%20image%2020220723214311.png)\n\n## ELB - Health Checks\n\n![Pasted image 20220723214425](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Compute/Pasted%20image%2020220723214425.png)\n\n\n## Cross-Zone Load Balancing\n![Pasted image 20220723214447](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Compute/Pasted%20image%2020220723214447.png)\n\n\n## ALB - Request Routing\n\nApply riles to incomming request and then forward or redirect traffic\n\n- Host header\n- HTTP header\n- Source IP\n- HTTP header method\n- Path\n- Query string\n![Pasted image 20220723214622](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Compute/Pasted%20image%2020220723214622.png)\n\n\n\n![Pasted image 20220723214636](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Compute/Pasted%20image%2020220723214636.png)","lastmodified":"2023-03-22T01:00:48.473014544Z","tags":null},"/Cloud-Computing/AWS/Compute/Lambda":{"title":"Lambda","content":"# Lambda\n#aws #cloud #serverless #compute #development \n\n\nRun code without provisioning or managing servers in [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md).\n\nLambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically to a few to a 1000 lambda functions concurrently in seconds.\n\nPay only for the times the lambda function is invoked.\n\nLambda is **Cheap**, **Serverless**, and **Scales Automatically**.\n\n7 runtime languages are supported:\n\n1.

They are limited in number (12) and has a higher cache bandwidth.\n\n• You can define a maximum Time To Live (TTL) and a default TTL\n• TTL is defined at the behavior level\n• This can be used to define different TTLs for different file types (e.g. png vs jpg)\n• After expiration, CloudFront checks the origin for any new requests (check the file is the latest version) \n• Headers can be used to control the cache:\n\t• *Cache-Control max-age=(seconds)* - specify how long before CloudFront gets the object again from the origin server\n\t• *Expires* – specify an expiration date and time\n\nA typical caching setup will look like:\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230312212643.png)\n\nA typical traffic from users accessing an imge will look like:\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230312213047.png)\n\n### Path Pattern\n\nYou can configure Cloudfront to get different files from different origins.\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230312213320.png)\n\n### Request Headers:\n• You can configure CloudFront to forward headers in the viewer request to the origin\n• CloudFront can then cache multiple versions of an object based on the values in one or more request headers\n• Controlled in a behavior to do one of the following:\n\t• Forward all headers to your origin (objects are not cached)\n\t• Forward a whitelist of headers that you specify\n\t• Forward only the default headers (doesn’t cache objects based on values in request headers)\n\n\n## Lambda@Edge\n\nWe use these functions to override the behaviour of request and responces\n![Pasted image 20220723225149](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220723225149.png)\n\n A common use case will be using it to authenticate users before they can access secured web content which needs to be authorised via cognito or similar case\n\n• Run Node.js and Python Lambda functions to customize the content CloudFront delivers\n• Executes functions closer to the viewer\n• Can be run at the following points\n• After CloudFront receives a request from a viewer (viewer request)\n• Before CloudFront forwards the request to the origin (origin request)\n• After CloudFront receives the response from the origin (origin response)\n• Before CloudFront forwards the response to the viewer (viewer response)\n\n\n## CloudFront-Protection\nBy default a Distribution allows everyone to have access.\n\n### Signed URLs\n  \n\nThe signed URL **allows the user to download or stream the content**. This step is automatic; the user usually doesn't have to do anything additional to access the content. For example, if a user is accessing your content in a web browser, your application returns the signed URL to the browser. Also see [S3 Presigned URLs](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Storage/S3.md#S3%20Presigned%20URLs) which gives user temporary access to a file in the bucket.\n\nIn order to use Signed URLs or Signed Cookies you need to have an [Original Identity Access (OAI)](#Original%20Identity%20Access%20(OAI)).\nTo controll the access of content by users \n\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230312213555.png)\n\n### Signed Cookies\n• Similar to Signed URLs\n• Use signed cookies when you don’t want to change URLs\n• Can also be used when you want to provide access to multiple restricted files (Signed URLs are for individual files)\n\n\n### Original Identity Access (OAI)\nA virtual user identity that will be users to give your CloudFront Distribution permission to fetch a private object.\n\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230312214745.png)\n\n\n## Cloudfront SSL/TLS\n\n#TODO \n- [ ] Write this\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230312220625.png)\n\n#TODO \n- [ ] Write this\n## Cloudfront SNI\n\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230312220733.png)","lastmodified":"2023-03-22T01:00:48.525019032Z","tags":null},"/Cloud-Computing/AWS/Networking/DX":{"title":"DX","content":"# Direct Connect (DX)\n#aws #cloud #networking \n\nAWS Direct Connect is a network service that provides an alternative to using the Internet to utilize [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md) cloud services.

Like if you have a domain `example.com` registered in your account that you want to point to a s3 bucket, you can create a a record in the zone to point it to the resources so the world can access it.\n\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230312203334.png)\n\n## Private Hosted Zones\nHowever you can use any domain you like within the account which the public cannot access.

Simple Routing Policy\nIts the most basic routing policy in Route53\nIt is also the default Routing policy\n1 record and provide multiple IP addresses.\nWhen multiple values are specified the Route53 will return all\n\nThis is the default routing policy. Use this only when you have exactly one resource such as one EC2 web server. This policy can contain multiple values but it returns one resource. This policy is not recommend for production sites.\n\n![Pasted image 20220720094522](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220720094522.png)\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230312205630.png)\n\n### 2. Weighted\nThis routing policy lets you split up traffic based on different 'weights' assigned to the routes allowing user to send a certain percentage of overall traffic apart from that directed to a different server.\nIt’s based on a numer2ical value ranging from 0 to 255. If you specify a value of 0 for all regions then it’s routed equally.\n\n![Pasted image 20220720101226](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220720101226.png)\n![Pasted image 20220720101237](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220720101237.png)\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230312205644.png)\n\n\n### 3. Latency\nWhen you have multiple resources in multiple regions, this policy routes the user not to the closest resource necessarily but the resource who responds the fastest or lowest latency.\n![Pasted image 20220720101348](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220720101348.png)\n\n![Pasted image 20220720101321](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220720101321.png)\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230312205658.png)\n\n\n### 4. Failover\nAllows creating two records for the same name. This starts like simple policy but with a health check. If that single web server is unhealthy then you can point elsewhere. That next pointer can be another web server or possibly an error.html page hosted in AWS S3.\n![Pasted image 20220720101408](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220720101408.png)\n![Pasted image 20220720101903](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220720101903.png)\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230312205852.png)\n\n\n### 5. Geolocation\nUse this when you want to serve your site based on the location of the client or user. ie. different servers for different users from regions. Like how all users from North American subcontinent to servers in one american servers and traffic from Asia to one of the servers in Asia.\n![Pasted image 20220720101949](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220720101949.png)\n![Pasted image 20220720094744](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220720094744.png)\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230312205905.png)\n\n\n### 6. Geoproximity\nGeoproximity routing lets Amazon Route 53 route traffic to your resources based on the geographic location of your users and your resources. You can also optionally choose to route more traffic or less to a given resource by specifying a value, known as a _bias_. A bias expands or shrinks the size of the geographic region from which traffic is routed to a resource.\n\nThe effect of changing the bias for your resources depends on a number of factors, including the following:\n\n-   The number of resources that you have.\n    \n-   How close the resources are to one another.\n    \n-   The number of users that you have near the border area between geographic regions. For example, suppose you have resources in the AWS Regions US East (Northern Virginia) and US West (Oregon) and you have a lot of users in Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio, Texas, USA. Those cities are roughly equidistant between your resources, so a small change in bias could result in a large swing in traffic from resources in one AWS Region to the other.\n\n![Pasted image 20220720094814](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220720094814.png)\n\n![Pasted image 20220720094827](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220720094827.png)\n![Pasted image 20220720094850](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220720094850.png)\n\n\n\n### 7. Multivalue\nThis one lets your return multiple values for each of your resources. The client or user browser randomly chooses one. Optionally you can add health checks. If any value becomes unhealthy then the client chooses another value to resolve. This is not an alternative solution to load balancing, it’s an enhancement. This is similar to the [#1 Simple Routing Policy](#1%20Simple%20Routing%20Policy) routing except .\n\n![Pasted image 20220720102628](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220720102628.png)\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230312210004.png)\n\n\n## Health Checks\n\nChecks health every 30s by default. Can be reduced to every 10s.\nA health check can initiate a failover if the status is returned to unhealthy.\nA CloudWatch Alarm can be created to alert you about the health of the route.\nHealth check can monitor other health checks to create a chain of reactions.\nCan create up to 50 health checks for AWS endpoints that are within or linked to the same AWS Account.\n\n\n## Traffic Flow:\nA visual editor which lets you create routing configurations for your resources using existing routing types.\n\n\n## Route 53 Resolver\n\nAmazon Route 53 Resolver responds recursively to DNS queries from AWS resources for public records, Amazon VPC-specific DNS names, and Amazon Route 53 private hosted zones, and is available by default in all VPCs.\n\nA Route 53 Resolver forwarding rule is configured to forward queries to internal.example.com in the on-premises data center. The query is forwarded to an outbound endpoint. The outbound endpoint forwards the query to the on-premises DNS resolver through a private connection between AWS and the data center.\n\n**Outbound Endpoints**\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230312212050.png)\n\n**Inbound Endpoints**\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230312212116.png)","lastmodified":"2023-03-22T01:00:48.565022354Z","tags":null},"/Cloud-Computing/AWS/Networking/Security-Groups":{"title":"Security Groups","content":"# Security Groups\n#aws #cloud #networking \n\n\nAn [AWS](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/AWS.md) stateful firewall service that controls the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the resources that it is associated with in an instance level.\n\nWhen you create a VPC, it comes with a default security group.

Instances behave as if they were on the same private network.\nPeering uses a star Configuration if you were to connect multiple different VPC i.e. a VPC will need to be in the middle of every other VPCs. (No Transitive peering)\nThe following peering configurations are invalid:\n\n-   Overlapping CIDR blocks\n-   Transitive peering\n-   Edge to edge routing through a gateway or private connection\n\n[More info on invalid peering configurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/invalid-peering-configurations.html)\n\nVPC peering is only supported in a star configuration.\n\nTransitive peering / edge-to-edge routing is not supported. i.e. if you have VPC A \u003c-\u003e VPC B \u003c-\u003e VPC C, VPC A can communicate with VPC B, and VPC B with C, but A cannot directly communicate with C unless a direct connection is made between A and C.\n\n[More info on VPC peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-peering.html)\n\n**You must update both sides of the route tables for VPC peering to work**\n\n\n## Route Tables\nRoute tables are used to determine where the network traffic is directed. Each subnet in VPC must be associated with a route table. \nA subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time.\nA route table can be used to associate multiple subnets.\nEach record in the route table is called a route.\n\nIn VPCs, even though we have these different subnets, we need to allow traffic to flow through them. We do this with Route Tables. **A Route Table is just a list of CIDR blocks (IP ranges) that our traffic can leave and come from.** By default, newly created Route Tables will have the CIDR of our VPC defined. This means that traffic from anywhere within our VPC is allowed.\n\nIn addition to a list of IP ranges that our Route Table connect traffic between, it also has **Subnet Associations**. Simply put, these are \"which subnets use this route table.\"\n\n\n\n## Internet Gateway\n\nCreating a VPC also creates a route table, but doesn’t create a subnet or internet gateway by default.\n\nFor a VPC route table point to an internet gateway, you must first attach the internet gateway to the VPC.\n\n**You can attach only one internet gateway to a VPC at a time**; if youre getting an error when trying to attach an Internet Gateway to a VPC, it could be that an Internet Gateway is already attached to the VPC.\n\nBefore deleting an IGW, you must first detach it from the VPC it’s attached to.\n\n[More info on VPC Internet Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html)\n\n\n## Direct Connect\n\nA solution for establishing dedicated network connections from on-premises locations to AWS.\n\nVery fast network with Lower bandwidth of 50M-500M or Higher Bandwidth 1GB or 10GB.\n\nHelps reduce network costs and increase bandwidth throughput\nProvides a more consistent network experience than internet based connections. (reliable and secure)\n\n## VPC Endpoints\n\nVPC endpoints allow you to privately connect your VPC to other AWS services, and VPC endpoint services.\n\nEliminates the need for [#Internet Gateway](#Internet%20Gateway), NAT device, VPN connection or even AWS Direct Connect connections.\n\nInstances in the VPC do not require public IP address to communicate with service resources.\n\nTraffic between your VPC and other services does not leave the AWS network.\n\nHorizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available.\n\nAllows secure communication between instances and services without adding availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your traffic.\n\n![Pasted image 20220715002212](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220715002212.png)\n### Interface endpoints\n\n![Pasted image 20220715002052](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220715002052.png)\n\n\n### Gateway Endpoint\n\nA gateway endpoint is a target for specific route in your route table. \nOnly support [DynamoDB](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Databases/DynamoDB.md) and [S3](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Storage/S3.md)\n\nGateway endpoints are free\n\n\n\n## VPC Flow Logs\n\ncaptures IP traffic information flow of Network Interfaces withhin VPC.\ncan be created for:\n\t- VPC\n\t- Subnets\n\t- Network Interface\n\nAll data is stored in Amazon Cloudwatch logs\nCan be viewed in detail in Cloudwatch logs,\nCannot do much than delete it.\nCannot be tagged like other resources\ncan be delivered to S3 or cloudwatch logs\nsome instance traffic can not be monitored\n\n![Pasted image 20220715002555](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220715002555.png)\n\n![Pasted image 20220715002614](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220715002614.png)\n\n## VPC Virtual Private Gateway\n\nAn Amazon VPC VPN connection links your data-center (or network) to your Amazon VPC virtual private cloud (VPC). A customer gateway is the anchor on your side of that connection. It can be a physical or software appliance. The anchor on the AWS side of the VPN connection is called a virtual private gateway.\n\n[More info](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/adminguide/Introduction.html)\n\n\n\n### CIDR - Classless Inter-domain Routing\n\n\n• CIDR block size can be between /16 and /28\n• The CIDR block must not overlap with any existing CIDR block\nthat's associated with the VPC\n• You cannot increase or decrease the size of an existing CIDR block\n• The first four and last IP address are not available for use\n\n-   10.0.0.0: Network address.\n-   10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.\n-   10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS for DNS.\n-   10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.\n-   10.0.0.255: Network broadcast address. We do not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore we reserve this address.\n\nNetwork masks:\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230305152101.png)\n-   /16 - supports up to 65,536 IP addresses.

You can focus on rapid application development and accelerating your time to market rather than having to manage virtual machines and infrastructure. You can continue to develop your application with the open-source tools and platform of your choice, without having to learn new skills.\n\nThe Single Server deployment option offers three pricing tiers: Basic, General Purpose, and Memory Optimized. Each tier offers different resource capabilities to support your database workloads. You can build your first app on a small database for a few dollars a month, then adjust the scale to meet the needs of your solution. Dynamic scalability enables your database to transparently respond to rapidly changing resource requirements. You only pay for the resources you need, and only when you need them.\n\n**Hyperscale (Citus)**\nThe Hyperscale (Citus) option horizontally scales queries across multiple machines by using sharding. Its query engine parallelizes incoming SQL queries across these servers for faster responses on large datasets. It serves applications that require greater scale and performance, generally workloads that are approaching, or already exceed, 100 GB of data.\n\nThe Hyperscale (Citus) deployment option supports multi-tenant applications, real-time operational analytics, and high-throughput transactional workloads. Applications built for PostgreSQL can run distributed queries on Hyperscale (Citus) with standard connection libraries and minimal changes.\n\n\n### Azure SQL Managed Instance (MI) \n\nSQL Managed Instance (SQL MI) provides native Virtual Network (VNet) integration while Azure SQL Database enables restricted Virtual Network (VNet) access using [VNET](Cloud%20Computing/Azure/VNET.md) Endpoints and SQL MI also helps bridge the gap between Azure SQL Database and On-premises SQL Server due to being built on an instance scoped configuration model.\n\nAzure SQL Managed Instance (MI) is similar to The Azure [SQL-Database](Cloud%20Computing/Azure/SQL-Database.md) on the following topics:\nManagement\n1. Backup\n2. Availability\n3. Host Accessibility\n4. License\n\nHowever the key differences are:\n**1. Recovery model**  \n_Azure SQL Database_: From automated backups only.  \n_SQL MI_: From automated backups and from full backups placed on Azure Blob Storage.\n\n**2. Active Geo-replication**  \n_SQL Database:_ Supported. In all service tiers other than Hyperscale.  \n_SQL MI:_ Not supported. alternative solution is [Auto-failover groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/auto-failover-group-overview).\n\n**3. Auto-failover groups**  \n_SQL Database:_ Supported. In all service tiers other than Hyperscale.  \n_SQL MI:_ Supported.\n\n**4. Auto-scale**  \n_SQL Database:_ Only supported in Serverless model.  \n_SQL MI:_ Not supported. You need to choose reserved compute and storage (vCore or max storage).\n\n**5. Automatic tuning (indexes)**  \n_SQL Database:_ Supported.  \n_SQL MI:_ Not supported.\n\n**6. Elastic jobs**  \n_SQL Database:_ Supported.  \n_SQL MI:_ Not supported. [SQL Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/transact-sql-tsql-differences-sql-server#sql-server-agent) can be used instead.\n\n**7. Long-term backup retention (LTR)**  \n_SQL Database:_ Supported. keep automatically taken backups up to 10 years.  \n_SQL MI:_ Not supported yet. Manual backups as a temporary workaround.\n\n**8. Hyperscale architecture**  \n_SQL Database:_ Supported.  \n_SQL MI:_ Not supported.\n\n**9. SQL Server Profiler**  \n_SQL Database:_ Not supported.  \n_SQL MI:_ Supported.\n\n**10. Cross-database transactions**  \n_SQL Database:_ Not supported.  \n_SQL MI:_ Supported.\n\n**11. Database mail (DbMail)**  \n_SQL Database:_ Not supported.  \n_SQL MI:_ Supported.\n\n**12.

You can use a VNets to:\n\n-   **Communicate between Azure resources**: You can deploy VMs, and several other types of Azure resources to a virtual network, such as Azure App Service Environments, the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets.\n    \n-   **Communicate between each other**: You can connect virtual networks to each other, enabling resources in either virtual network to communicate with each other, using virtual network peering. The virtual networks you connect can be in the same, or different, Azure regions.\n    \n-   **Communicate to the internet**: All resources in a VNet can communicate outbound to the internet, by default. You can communicate inbound to a resource by assigning a public IP address or a public Load Balancer. You can also use [Public IP addresses](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-public-ip-address) or public [Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) to manage your outbound connections.\n    \n-   **Communicate with on-premises networks**: You can connect your on-premises computers and networks to a virtual network using [VPN Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) or [ExpressRoute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction).\n    \n\nWhen you design a network from bottom up, you gather some basic information. This information could be number of hosts, network devices, number of [Subnet](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Networking/Subnet.md), routing between subnets, isolation domains such as VLANs. This information helps in sizing the network and security devices as well creating the architecture to support applications and services.\n\nWhen you plan to deploy your applications and services in Azure, you will start by creating a logical boundary in Azure, which is called a virtual network. This virtual network is akin to a physical network boundary. As it is a virtual network, you don't need physical gear but still have to plan for the logical entities such as IP addresses, IP subnets, routing, and policies.\n\nWhen you create a virtual network in Azure, it's pre-configured with an IP range (10.0.0.0/16). This range isn't fixed, you can define your own IP range. You can define both IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges. IP ranges defined for the virtual network are not advertised to Internet. You can create multiple subnets from your IP range. These subnets will be used to assign IP addresses to virtual network interfaces (vNICs). Azure reserves the first four and last IP address for a total of 5 IP addresses within each subnet. There is no concept of VLANs in a public cloud. However, you can create isolation within a virtual network based on your defined subnets.\n\nYou can create one large subnet encompassing all the virtual network address space or choose to create multiple subnets.\n\nA virtual network is a virtual, isolated portion of the Azure public network. Each virtual network is dedicated to your subscription. Things to consider when deciding whether to create one virtual network, or multiple virtual networks in a subscription:\n\n-   Do any organizational security requirements exist for isolating traffic into separate virtual networks? You can choose to connect virtual networks or not. If you connect virtual networks, you can implement a network virtual appliance, such as a firewall, to control the flow of traffic between the virtual networks.

The journey to the cloud begins with choosing a cloud provider and provisioning private networks or extending their on-premise network. Customers looking to provision their resources in the cloud can choose from the different private networks offered by the various cloud providers. The two most deployed private networks are Virtual Network [VNET](Cloud%20Computing/Azure/VNET.md) and Virtual Private Cloud [VPC](Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Networking/VPC.md) from Microsoft and Amazon respectively. This blog looks at the similarities and differences between these two private network offerings with the goal of informing potential customers on what differentiates the two private networks and assist in their decision on which is suitable for their workload.

When you send an email message, you want to be sure that the message received is the same as the message you sent. When you store data in a database, you want to be sure that the data you retrieve is the same as the data you stored.

While it might be more secure to store the data in an encrypted format, employees need access to decrypted data.\n\nWhile the goals of a cybersecurity strategy are to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems, networks, applications, and data; it's the goal of cybercriminals to disrupt these goals.

Unlike other security models, which automatically trust individuals and devices that are already within the corporate network, zero trust advocates trusting no one at any time. The model was first described by John Kindervag, then a principal analyst at Forrester Research, in 2010.\n\n## Principles of Zero Trust\n\nZero Trust can best be described by the axiom “don’t trust, always verify.”\n\nIt acknowledges that traditional IT security models that seek to protect networks from outside threats but that inherently trust individuals or devices already within the network, are flawed. The reason is because that trust could be misplaced: there may be insider threats within the network in the form of an employee who wants to compromise corporate data, or a device that has been compromised by an outside attack, or a set of user security credentials that has been stolen by a bad actor outside of the organization.\n\nZero Trust proposes that by inherently trusting all users or devices within a network, traditional IT security models leave open the possibility that unchecked bad actors could roam freely within the corporate network, accessing more corporate data along the way, and raising the potential scale and severity of a cyberattack.\n\n## Zero Trust strategies\n\nBy comparison, the argument with Zero Trust is that organizations should assume their network has already been compromised and implement strategies or technologies to minimize further risk. Several of those strategies include:\n\n### Segregation of Duties (SoD) (Guiding Principals)\n\nThis principle describes the idea that no one individual or device should have full access to all of an organization’s critical IT sources. If that were to happen, then a hacker who gains control of that individual or device’s security credentials would have unfettered access to everything in the corporate network.\n\nExamples of too broad access include network firewalls and virtual private networks (VPNs). They isolate and limit access to technology resources and services but once you gain entry, you are trusted by default. \n\nAnother important dimension of SoD is that no individual should have multiple roles especially in the critical parts of the software publishing pipeline. For example, no developer should have access from test to production or be able to self-elevate privileges without proper oversight.\n\n### Least privilege access\n\nIn practice, the segregation of duties is achieved by giving each user a role with least privilege access, meaning that every user or device within the network can access only the most essential resources they need, and nothing else. The benefit is that if that user’s credentials or device is compromised by an outside attack, a hacker would only have access to that device’s environment, and nothing more than that, which reduces the potential security risk.\n\n### Microsegmentation\n\nSimilarly, the Zero Trust model favors microsegmentation, which involves splitting up the corporate IT environment into security zones and requiring separate authorization in order to access each of those zones. This practice limits the chance that a hacker could “jump” from one part of the network to another in order to access and compromise more sensitive data.\n\n### Multifactor authentication\n\nThis principle requires more than one method of authentication to verify user credentials. For example, rather than relying on a password alone, multifactor authentication might require that a user also input a secret code that has been sent to an email address or a mobile phone number that only the user should have access to.\n\n### Just-in-time access\n\n[Just-in-time access](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/just-in-time) is built around the idea that no user or machine identity should have permanent, always-on access to a critical resource. Instead, the identity is verified each time a connection is established but the authorization to access a resource disappears automatically after establishing the connection. This ensures that the identity requesting access goes through the required security controls every time.\n\n### Auditing and tracking\n\nA proper audit trail of activities ensures that there's always an up-to-date log of every connection along with a verified identity. Moreover, many Zero Trust solutions offer session recordings for knowing exactly what actions were taken in a session. This is very useful for forensics and for reporting in [Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/security-orchestration/siem) systems.\n\n### Zero Trust technologies\n\nA number of technology solutions have been created to address aspects of the Zero Trust framework, including but not limited to:\n\n-   [Cloud-IAM](Cyber%20Security/Cloud%20Security/Cloud-IAM.md)\n    \n-   [Privileged access management (PAM)](https://www.ssh.com/iam/pam)\n    \n-   Multifactor authentication\n    \n-   Encryption software\n    \n\nSSH.COM has developed a comprehensive set of Zero Trust solutions to mitigate the risk of managing digital keys, privileged passwords and other secrets (like API tokens or certificates) by greatly reducing their numbers in IT infrastructures.

The key can be used to communicate securely with the certificate's subject if the software examining the certificate agrees and the signature is valid. \n\nFrom Wikipedia :\n\nIn email encryption, code signing, and e-signature systems, a certificate's subject is typically a person or organization. However, in Transport Layer Security (TLS) a certificate's subject is typically a computer or other device, though TLS certificates may identify organizations or individuals in addition to their core role in identifying devices. TLS, sometimes called by its older name Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is notable for being a part of HTTPS, a protocol for securely browsing the web.\n\n\nThere are many types of certificates:\n\n## TLS/SSL Server Certificate\n\n\n## TLS/SSL Client Certificate\n\n\n## Email Certificate\n\n## Self-signed \u0026 Root Certificate\n\n## Other Certificate","lastmodified":"2023-03-22T01:00:48.609026007Z","tags":null},"/Cyber-Security/Cryptography/Certificate-Authority":{"title":"Certificate Authority","content":"# Certificate Authority (CA)\n#cyber-security #security #encryption \n\nIn cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority is an central entity that stores, signs, and issues digital certificates.

Each time the same text is hashed using the same algorithm, the same hash value is produced. That hash can then be used as a unique identifier of its associated data.\n\nHashing is different to [Encryption](Cyber%20Security/Cryptography/Encryption.md) in that it doesn't use keys, and the hashed value isn't subsequently decrypted back to the original.\n\nHashing is used to store passwords. When a user enters their password, the same algorithm that created the stored hash creates a hash of the entered password. This is compared to the stored hashed version of the password. If they match, the user has entered their password correctly. This is more secure than storing plain text passwords, but hashing algorithms are also known to hackers. Because hash functions are deterministic (the same input produces the same output), hackers can use brute-force dictionary attacks by hashing the passwords. For every matched hash, they know the actual password. To mitigate this risk, passwords are often “salted”. This refers to adding a fixed-length random value to the input of hash functions to create unique hashes for same input.\n\n![The concept of hashing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/media/6-hashing-3-inline.png)","lastmodified":"2023-03-22T01:00:48.609026007Z","tags":null},"/Cyber-Security/ISO-27001":{"title":"ISO 27001","content":"#cyber-security ","lastmodified":"2023-03-22T01:00:48.609026007Z","tags":null},"/Cyber-Security/Multi-tier-Architecture":{"title":"Multi-tier Architecture","content":"# Secure Multi-tier Architecture\n#cloud #security \n\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230321162851.png)\n\n\n![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230321161213.png)","lastmodified":"2023-03-22T01:00:48.609026007Z","tags":null},"/Cyber-Security/NIST":{"title":"NIST","content":"#cyber-security ","lastmodified":"2023-03-22T01:00:48.609026007Z","tags":null},"/Cyber-Security/OWASP":{"title":"OWASP","content":"#cyber-security ","lastmodified":"2023-03-22T01:00:48.609026007Z","tags":null},"/Cyber-Security/Standards":{"title":"Standards","content":"#cyber-security \n\n[ISO 27001](Cyber%20Security/ISO%2027001.md)\n[NIST](Cyber%20Security/NIST.md)\n[OWASP](Cyber%20Security/OWASP.md)\n\n[GDPR](Cyber%20Security/GDPR.md)","lastmodified":"2023-03-22T01:00:48.609026007Z","tags":null},"/DevOps/CICD/Azure-DevOps":{"title":"Azure DevOps","content":"# Azure DevOps\n#azure #devops\n\n\n\n![Pasted image 20221210223636](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221210223636.png)\n\nConfiguring processes and communications\n\tConfigure activity traceability \nDesign and implement source control\nDesign and implement build and release pipelines 45%\n\n\t\nDevelop a security and compliance plan\nImplement an instrumentation strategy\n\n![Pasted image 20221210213337](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221210213337.png)","lastmodified":"2023-03-22T01:00:48.609026007Z","tags":null},"/DevOps/CICD/GitHub-Actions":{"title":"GitHub Actions","content":"# Github - Actions\n#CICD \n\nGitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline by [GitHub](DevOps/SCR/GitHub.md).

Which means the other services such as the Azure managed Control pane is free AKSAKSof cost.\n\n## Control plane\nWhen you create an AKS cluster, a control plane is automatically created and configured. This control plane is provided at no cost as a managed Azure resource abstracted from the user. You only pay for the nodes attached to the AKS cluster. The control plane and its resources reside only on the region where you created the cluster.\n\n![Pasted image 20220928225117](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220928225117.png)\n\n\n## Node pools\nNode pools use virtual machine scale sets as the underlying infrastructure to allow the cluster to scale the number of nodes in a node pool. New nodes created in the node pool will always be the same size as you specified when you created the node pool.\n![Pasted image 20220930162008](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220930162008.png)\n\n\n## Networking\nAn Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster blocks all inbound traffic from the internet to the cluster to assure network security. Deployed workloads in Kubernetes are, by default, only accessible from inside the cluster. To expose the applications to the outside world, you need to open specific ports and forward them to your services. The network configuration for containers is temporary. A container's configuration and the data in it isn't persistent between executions. After you delete a container, all information is gone unless it's configured to use a volume. The same applies to the container's network configuration and any IP addresses assigned to it.\n\nKubernetes has two network availability abstractions that allow you to expose any app: _services_ and _ingresses_ They're both responsible for allowing and redirecting the traffic from external sources to the cluster.\n\n## Service\nA Kubernetes service is a workload that abstracts the IP address for networked workloads. A Kubernetes service acts as a load balancer and redirects traffic to the specified ports by using port-forwarding rules.\n\nA diagram that shows two Kubernetes services. The first service is applied to one pod. The second service is applied to two pods.\n\nYou define a service in the same way as a deployment, by using a YAML manifest file. The service uses the same selector key as deployments to select and group resources with matching labels into one single IP.\n\nA Kubernetes service needs four pieces of information to route traffic.\n\n| Information|Description     |\n| --- | --- |\n|  **Target resource** |The target resource is defined by the `selector` key in the service manifest file. This value selects all the resources with a given label onto a single IP address.       |\n|**Service port** |This port is the inbound port for your application. All the requests come to |this port from where the service forwards the requests to the resource.\n|**Network protocol** |This value identifies the network protocol for which the service will forward network data.|\n|**Resource port** | This value identifies the port on the target resource on which incoming requests are received. This port is defined by the `targetPort` key in the service manifest file. |\n### Types of services:\n\nServices can be of several types. Each type changes the behavior of the applications selected by the service.\n\n-   **ClusterIP**: This value exposes the applications internally only. This option allows the service to act as a port-forwarder and makes the service available within the cluster. This value is the default when omitted.\n    \n-   **NodePort**: This value exposes the service externally. It assigns each node a static port that responds to that service. When accessed through `nodeIp:port`, the node automatically redirects the request to an internal service of the `ClusterIP` type. This service then forwards the request to the applications.\n    \n-   **LoadBalancer**: This value exposes the service externally by using Azure's load-balancing solution. When created, this resource spins up an Azure Load Balancer resource within your Azure subscription. Also, this type automatically creates a `NodePort` service to which the load balancer's traffic is redirected and a `ClusterIP` service to forward it internally.\n    \n-   **ExternalName**: This value maps the service by using a DNS resolution through a CNAME record. You use this service type to direct traffic to services that exist outside the Kubernetes cluster.\n\n## Ingress Controller\nIngress controllers provide the capability to deploy and expose your applications to the world without the need to configure network-related services. \n\nIngress controllers create a reverse-proxy server that automatically allows for all the requests to be served from a single DNS output. You don't have to create a DNS record every time a new service is deployed. The ingress controller will take care of it. When a new ingress is deployed to the cluster, the ingress controller creates a new record on an Azure managed DNS zone and links it to an existing load balancer. This functionality allows for easy access to the resource through the internet without the need for additional configuration.\n\n- Acts as a reverse proxy to allow external URLs.\n- Might act as a load balancer.\n- Terminates SSL/TLS requests.\n- Offers name-based virtual hosting.\n\n![Pasted image 20220930162708](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220930162708.png)\n\n![Pasted image 20220930162112](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220930162112.png)\n\n\n## Demo\nTo setup a basic AKS cluster which simply hosts a static webapp.\n\n### Requirements\n1.

The main Kubernetes master is also known as a master nodes. It then manages other nodes also known as Worker nodes. The master node contains the main kubernetes master service which provides the user with essential API to do various operations to the services that takes instructions from the main administrator and operated accordingly. Another key component of the kubernetes is the Image Registry service which is usually third party.

Subnets make networks more efficient. Through subnetting, network traffic can travel a shorter distance without passing through unnecessary [routers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-routing/) to reach its destination.\n\n![zSubnet2.png](Attachments/zSubnet2.png.png)\nLike the postal service, networks are more efficient when messages travel as directly as possible. When a network receives data packets from another network, it will sort and route those packets by subnet so that the packets do not take an inefficient route to their destination.\n\n## What is an IP address?\n\nIn order to understand subnets, we must quickly define [IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/). Every device that connects to the Internet is assigned a unique IP ([Internet Protocol](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/internet-protocol/)) address, enabling data sent over the Internet to reach the right device out of the billions of devices connected to the Internet. While computers read IP addresses as binary code (a series of 1s and 0s), IP addresses are usually written as a series of alphanumeric characters.\n\n## What do the different parts of an IP address mean?\n\nThis section focuses on IPv4 addresses, which are presented in the form of four decimal numbers separated by periods, like 203.0.113.112. (IPv6 addresses are longer and use letters as well as numbers.)\n\nEvery IP address has two parts. The first part indicates which network the address belongs to. The second part specifies the device within that network. However, the length of the \"first part\" changes depending on the network's class.\n\nNetworks are categorized into different classes, labeled A through E. Class A networks can connect millions of devices. Class B networks and Class C networks are progressively smaller in size. (Class D and Class E networks are not commonly used.)\n\nLet's break down how these classes affect IP address construction:\n\n**Class A network:** Everything before the first period indicates the network, and everything after it specifies the device within that network. Using 203.0.113.112 as an example, the network is indicated by \"203\" and the device by \"0.113.112.\"\n\n**Class B network:** Everything before the second period indicates the network. Again using 203.0.113.112 as an example, \"203.0\" indicates the network and \"113.112\" indicates the device within that network.\n\n**Class C network:** For Class C networks, everything before the third period indicates the network. Using the same example, \"203.0.113\" indicates the Class C network, and \"112\" indicates the device.\n\n## Why is subnetting necessary?\n\nAs the previous example illustrates, the way IP addresses are constructed makes it relatively simple for Internet routers to find the right network to route data into. However, in a Class A network (for instance), there could be millions of connected devices, and it could take some time for the data to find the right device. This is why subnetting comes in handy: subnetting narrows down the IP address to usage within a range of devices.\n\nBecause an IP address is limited to indicating the network and the device address, IP addresses cannot be used to indicate which subnet an IP packet should go to. Routers within a network use something called a subnet mask to sort data into subnetworks.\n\n## What is a subnet mask?\n\nA subnet mask is like an IP address, but for only internal usage within a network. Routers use subnet masks to route data packets to the right place. Subnet masks are not indicated within data packets traversing the Internet — those packets only indicate the destination IP address, which a router will match with a subnet.\n\nSuppose Bob answers Alice's letter, but he sends his reply to Alice's place of employment rather than her home. Alice's office is quite large with many different departments. To ensure employees receive their correspondence quickly, the administrative team at Alice's workplace sorts mail by department rather than by individual employee. After receiving Bob's letter, they look up Alice's department and see she works in Customer Support. They send the letter to the Customer Support department instead of to Alice, and the customer support department gives it to Alice.\n\nIn this analogy, \"Alice\" is like an IP address and \"Customer Support\" is like a subnet mask. By matching Alice to her department, Bob's letter was quickly sorted into the right group of potential recipients. Without this step, office administrators would have to spend time laboriously looking for the exact location of Alice's desk, which could be anywhere in the building.\n\nFor a real-world example, suppose an IP packet is addressed to the IP address 192.0.2.15. This IP address is a Class C network, so the network is identified by \"192.0.2\" (or to be technically precise, 192.0.2.0/24). Network routers forward the packet to a host on the network indicated by \"192.0.2.\"\n\nOnce the packet arrives at that network, a router within the network consults its routing table. It does some binary mathematics using its subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, sees the device address \"15\" (the rest of the IP address indicates the network), and calculates which subnet the packet should go to. It forwards the packet to the router or [switch](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-network-switch/) responsible for delivering packets within that subnet, and the packet arrives at IP address 192.0.2.15 (learn more about [routers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-routing/) and [switches](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-network-switch/)).\n\n# CIDR\n**CIDR - Classless Inter-domain Routing**\n\n**The first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet CIDR block are not available for you to use, and cannot be assigned to an instance.**\n\ni.e.\n\n-   10.0.0.0: Network address.\n-   10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.\n-   10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS for DNS.\n-   10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.\n-   10.0.0.255: Network broadcast address. We do not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore we reserve this address.\n\nNetwork masks:\n\n-   /16 - supports up to 65,536 IP addresses. Best for large networks.\n-   /24 - supports up to 256 IP addresses. Best for smaller networks.\n-   /27 - supports up to 32 IP addresses\n-   /28 - supports up to 16 IP addresses\n-   /32 - an absolute IP address - matches exactly one\n\nIt’s possible to split a CIDR block into two subnets:\n\n-   one subnet can use CIDR block 10.0.0.0/25 (for addresses 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.127)\n-   and then the other subnet can use the CIDR block 10.0.0.128/ 25 (for addresses 10.0.0.128 - 10.0.0.255)\n\nThe allowed CIDR block size in a VPC is between a /16 and /28 subnetmask.\n\nTo enable ping, you need to allow ICMP traffic.\n\nIn order to ensure provisioned EC2 instances have a public IP address, enable “Auto-Assign Public IP” for the subnet.\n\n0.0.0.0/0 is also known as default \nIt represents all possible IP addresses\u003e)\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-22T01:00:48.765038962Z","tags":null},"/Networking/Webservers":{"title":"Webservers","content":"\n[Nginx](Cyber%20Operations/Operation%20Tools/Nginx.md)","lastmodified":"2023-03-22T01:00:48.765038962Z","tags":null}}
