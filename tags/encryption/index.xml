Another service in AWS which allows management of Encryption keys. It is a cloud based hardware security module (HSM).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Cryptography/Certificate-Authority/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Cryptography/Certificate-Authority/</guid><description>Certificate Authority (CA) #cyber-security #security #encryption
In cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority is an central entity that stores, signs, and issues digital certificates.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Cryptography/Certificate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Cryptography/Certificate/</guid><description>Certificate #cyber-security #security #encryption
Also known as a digital certificate or identity certificate, is an electronic document used to prove the validity of a public key usually issued by a public Certificate Authority.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Cryptography/Decryption/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Cryptography/Decryption/</guid><description>Decryption #cyber-security #security #encryption
While Encryption masks/converts the information to something unintelligible, this process will reverse this process and use the key to create useful information from jumbled encrypted information.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Cryptography/Encryption-Asymmetric/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Cryptography/Encryption-Asymmetric/</guid><description>Asymmetric Encryption #cyber-security #security #encryption
Also known as public key cryptography where messages are Encrypted with the public key can only be Decrypted with the private key.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Cryptography/Encryption-in-Rest/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Cryptography/Encryption-in-Rest/</guid><description>Encryption in rest #cyber-security #security #encryption
Encryption of data at rest ensures the data is unreadable without the keys and secrets needed to de-crypt it.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Cryptography/Encryption-in-Transit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Cryptography/Encryption-in-Transit/</guid><description>Encryption in transit #cyber-security #security #encryption
Encryption of data in transit is the data moving from one location to another, such as across the internet or through a private network.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Cryptography/Encryption-Symmetric/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Cryptography/Encryption-Symmetric/</guid><description>Symmetric Encryption #cyber-security #security #encryption
Unlike Asymmetric Encryption this technique requires only one key which is used to perform Encryption as well as Decryption.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Cryptography/Encryption/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Cryptography/Encryption/</guid><description>Encryption #cyber-security #security #encryption
Encryption is the process of making data unreadable and unusable to unauthorized viewers by using of a secret key to access the data.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Hashing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrestharajat.com/Cyber-Security/Hashing/</guid><description>Hashing #cyber-security #security #encryption
Hashing uses an algorithm to convert text to a unique fixed-length value called a hash. Each time the same text is hashed using the same algorithm, the same hash value is produced.</description></item></channel></rss>
